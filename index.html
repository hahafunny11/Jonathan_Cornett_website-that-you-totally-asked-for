        <p>>Hello. My name is Jonathan Cornett.</p>
        <p>>Currently, I am a GDIM Major.</p>
        <p>>Five years from now, I intend to be working my dream job: Making Video Games. I plan to do this by learning the ins and outs of how video games and their code works, and by feeding into my preexisting talent for coding. I'd also like to design websites at some point.</p>
        <p>>How good am I at coding? Well, we could talk about that over a <a href="https://hahafunny11.github.io/Final-Project-Website/pong.html" target="_blank">game of Pong</a>... (Press W & S to move left paddle, Up & Down Arrows to move right paddle, and <a href="https://github.com/hahafunny11" target="_blank">here's proof that this was made by me</a>)</p>
        <p>>As for website skills, well... you're looking at it right now!</p>
        <p>>My biggest strength is my unending will, if I want something done, it WILL be done. My unique selling point is my unique coding style of assigning pretty much everything to a variable</p>
        <p>>I want to be known as a creative and unique coder with a style that is easy to understand by any onlookers, which is a necessity to succeed in the market.</p>
        <p>>I hope this convinces you of my skills!</p>
        <p>>I know you said to not do anything crazy, but I couldn't help myself!<JavaBlink>_</JavaBlink></p>
